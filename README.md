# 🌦️ Weather Tracker — Real-Time Weather Updates with Azure

A web application that allows users to track real-time weather updates for their chosen cities. The system integrates **Azure Functions** to trigger alerts when specific weather thresholds are met (e.g., rain forecast).

## 🚀 Infrastructure Overview
- **Azure App Service Web App** — Hosts the web application  
- **Azure Container Registry (ACR)** — Stores Docker images for the app  
- **Azure Container Instance (ACI)** — Runs containers for development/testing  
- **Azure Functions** — Sends weather alerts based on thresholds  
- **Azure Container Apps** — Runs containers in production

## ⚙️ Project Activities
In this project, I am:  
1. Creating an Azure App Service Web App to host the weather tracker.  
2. Developing a web application that retrieves real-time weather data via APIs.  
3. Containerizing the application for easier deployment and testing.  
4. Publishing the container image to Azure Container Registry.  
5. Testing the application using Azure Container Instance.  
6. Implementing an Azure Function to send alerts when specific weather thresholds are met.  
7. Integrating the Azure Function with the web application for real-time notifications.  
8. Deploying the web application to Azure Container Apps for production use.  
9. Setting up a CI/CD pipeline to automate deployment of both the application and the Function.  
10. Configuring Application Insights and Azure Monitor to track performance and alerts.  
11. Pushing the code to GitHub and maintaining detailed project documentation.
